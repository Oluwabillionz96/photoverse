# 📸 Screenshots Setup Guide

## Quick Setup Instructions

You have 5 screenshots to add to complete the documentation. Here's what to do:

### Step 1: Save Your Screenshots

Save the screenshots you shared with me to the `public/screenshots/` folder with these exact names:

```
public/screenshots/
├── hero-section.png          (Landing page hero)
├── photo-gallery.png         (Photo grid view)
├── folder-management.png     (Folders page)
├── login-page.png            (Login page)
├── register-page.png         (Register page)
└── photo-upload.png          (Upload modal)
```

### Step 2: Screenshot Mapping

Here's which screenshot goes where:

| Screenshot You Shared | Save As | Description |
|----------------------|---------|-------------|
| First screenshot (landing page with gallery) | `hero-section.png` | Landing page hero section |
| Second screenshot (photo grid with October 2025) | `photo-gallery.png` | Main photo gallery view |
| Third screenshot (folders: Revamp test, Hail mary, etc.) | `folder-management.png` | Folder management interface |
| Fourth screenshot (Welcome back login form) | `login-page.png` | Login page |
| Fifth screenshot (Create account form) | `register-page.png` | Registration page |
| Sixth screenshot (Ready to Upload modal) | `photo-upload.png` | Photo upload interface |

### Step 3: Verify

After saving the screenshots, check that they appear correctly:

1. **In README.md**: Open the README and scroll to the "Overview" section
2. **In GitHub**: Push to GitHub and view the README there
3. **In Documentation**: Check docs/FEATURES.md and docs/USER_GUIDE.md

### Alternative: Use Different Image Hosting

If you prefer to host images elsewhere (like Imgur, Cloudinary, or GitHub Issues), you can:

1. Upload images to your preferred host
2. Get the direct image URLs
3. Replace the image paths in README.md:

```markdown
<!-- Current (local) -->
![Hero Section](./public/screenshots/hero-section.png)

<!-- Alternative (hosted) -->
![Hero Section](https://your-image-host.com/hero-section.png)
```

### Files That Reference Screenshots

The screenshots are referenced in:
- ✅ `README.md` - Main project overview
- ✅ `public/screenshots/README.md` - Screenshot guide
- 📝 Can be added to `docs/FEATURES.md` if desired
- 📝 Can be added to `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` if desired

### Optional: Add More Screenshots

You can also add screenshots for:
- Email verification page
- Password reset flow
- Full-screen photo viewer
- Mobile responsive views
- Empty states
- Loading states

Just save them in `public/screenshots/` and reference them in the documentation.
